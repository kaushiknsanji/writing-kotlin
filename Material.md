# Writing Effective Kotlin

## 001 - Data Classes

There are typically two types of classes, divided by how they are used

1. Value types: These are classes that represent the _what_. They track information.
2. Transformer types: These are classes that represent business logic. They act upon value types and transform them according to business rules.
